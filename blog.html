    I first went to Breda for the programming study that was purely based on making games at the buas. I needed to go there by train, but there was a little accident with the trains so they were delayed for about an hour.
    I also visited the hz 2 times for the open days and i quite like it here
    I ended up going with this study, because I didn't only want to be able to make games, Breda was further away and the Hz just seemed better to me overall.
