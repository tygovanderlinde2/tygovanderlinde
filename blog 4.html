        <p>At this point, we're already at 2022. It was time to make a decision about which school I wanted to pick</p>
        <p>In the end, I decided on going with this study.</p>
        <p> This was partially because I didn't just want to focus on making games, but also be able to do a lot more
            things with the skills I will acquire here.</p>
        <p>Other reasons for going to the Hz instead of the BUAS are: Breda is further away from where I live and in
            general, I like the Hz a bit more compared to the BUAS.</p>

<!-- 2022: I ended up going with this study, because I didn't only want to be able to make games, Breda was further away and the Hz just seemed better to me overall. -->
