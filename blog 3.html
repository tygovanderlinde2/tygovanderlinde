    <p>In 2021, I went to Breda to visit the BUAS there. I was interested at first because of the gaming study they
      had there.</p>
    <p>The first time I had to go to BUAS by train, there was a tiny accident regarding the electricity supply for
      the train: one of the wires had broken off.</p>
    <p>This little accident caused the train that I had to take to Breda to have a delay of about an hour.</p>
    <p>I also went to Middelburg to visit the Hz as I was also really interested in the HBO-ICT study they had here.
    </p>
    <p>In the end, as you can see, the Hz ended up being my preference, so I applied here</p>
