            <p>Hello and welcome to a page about me</p>
        </div>
        <p>I am Tygo van der Linde, I am 18 years old.</p>
        <p>I have one little brother named Xavi, my mother's name is Sandra and my father's name is Peter.</p> <br>
        <p>I used to play <a style="text-decoration: none; color:dimgrey;" target="_blank"
                href="https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/realbusinessda/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/shutterstock_555863836.jpg">football</a>
            for the longest time, but I quit since it stopped being fun for me. I also started
            working a bit more around this time so for me, it was the perfect condition to earn a little more money.</p>
        <p>All of this was still in Zierikzee, where I used to live untill I was 17.</p>
        <p>A few years ago, we moved to 's-Heerhendrikskinderen. 's-Heerhendrikskinderen is very close to goes.</p> <br>
        <p>But since I quit my at the time only hobby, I did get kinda bored. Ofcourse, I was still working, but I
            wasn't always able to work. And that's when I discovered gaming.</p>
        <p>It all started by me going to a friend's house and playing on a playstation for the first time. When I came
            home later that day, I almost begged my parents to buy me and my little brother something like "a thing to
            play games on."</p>
        <p>My parents, reluctantly agreeing, bought us a wii and a few things to play with.</p>
        <p>It wasn't really a problem at the time, since we weren't playing to much and we were both keeping up with
            work and school.</p>
        <p>When I was almost done with my first year of middle school, a few friends of mine were talking about pc
            stuff.</p>
        <p>After hearing them, I formed an interest in pc's and pc building, it wouldn't take long before I build my
            very own <a style="text-decoration: none; color:dimgrey;" target="_blank"
                href="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.VfMsJ_PdUQlPevtKVSmNDQHaJ4?pid=ImgDet&rs=1">pc</a> all by myself.
        </p>
        <p>This, however, is where some problems started occurring, since I was spending a little more time every day
            behind my pc playing <a style="text-decoration: none; color:dimgrey;" target="_blank"
                href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f9/b9/3c/f9b93c9641d1fa291c8dc9d4ab3a503a.jpg">games</a>.</p>
        <p>Pc gaming didn't really inflict too much damage to my school carreer, but I'm quite sure I would have
            performed way better if I had never discovered games and never got addicted.</p>
        <p>After a while, I started noticing that, even though I knew pretty much everything about the hardware of pc's,
            I was still clueless about the software side of things.</p>
        <p>So I just needed to learn about this, no matter what it took.</p>
        <p>After a while of researching the software side of things, I realized that I was having a lot of fun doing
            these kinds of things. Looking back, this is what made me want to be a software engineer.</p>

            <h2>charactaristics:</h2>
            <p>- I think I'm decently lazy</p>
            <p>- I'm generally pretty patient, but when it comes to my little brother, I have much less patience.</P>
            <p>- Quite some people have called me pessimistic, but I prefer to call it realistic most of the time.</p>
            <p>- I can be quite stubbord sometimes, it all depends on the subject.</p>
            <p>- I like most candy/sweets, white chocolate being my favorite.</p>
            <p>- I can sometimes be a little bit picky when it comes to what I eat</p>
