    <h1 style="text-align:center; color: white;">welcome to my homepage</h1>
    <div>
      <p>My name is Tygo van der Linde, I am 18 years old, I have one little brother, a father and a mother.</p>
      <p>At home we have both a dog and a cat, our dog's name Shiva and our cat's name Ghaya.</p>
      <p>Shiva is almost 3 years old, and Ghaya is close to becoming 12.</p>
      <p>I used to live in Zierikzee, but as of 2 years ago, we moved to 's-Heerhendrikskinderen.</p> <br>
      <p>I used to play football, but quit since it became boring and annoying. The time I used to spend playing
        football, is now spend either working or gaming.</p>
      <p>I work at klok'uus, I usually work every Saturday during normal school weeks. But during the holidays, I'll be
        working almost every day.</p>
      <p>If I have nothing to do, I either play some games on my pc or just watch some youtube, my favorite games
        currently are: <a style="text-decoration: none; color:dimgrey;" target="_blank"
          href="https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en?utm_source=HoYoverse&utm_medium=banner">Genshin Impact</a> and <a
          style="text-decoration: none; color:dimgrey;" target="_blank"
          href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/977950/A_Dance_of_Fire_and_Ice/">A dance of fire and ice</a>.
      </p>
      <p>There are also some other games I occasionally still boot up just to have some fun, but I spend most of my
        time gaming playing Genshin Impact.</p>
